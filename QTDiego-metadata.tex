\AtlasAbstract{%
  Different algorithms have been trained by the ATLAS collaboration to separate true semi-hadronically decaying taus from QCD jets. The efficiency of these algorithms is compared in simulation and data and correction factors are derived to account for the differences that may arise from the simulation limitations. This study aims to evaluate the correction factors for the tau-ID algorithms for high-$\pt$ taus. Highly boosted $Z\to\tauhad\taulep$ events are used in this study. Two final states are explored, $\taulep\to l+\nu 's$, where $l=e \text{ or } \mu$.  The scale factors are calculated as a double ratio between $Z\to\tauhad\taulep$ and $\Zll$ events. This method helps to cancel phenomenological, luminosity and light-lepton related uncertainties. In addition, Z boson decays are safe from lepton universality violation concerns.  In this report, we present the values obtained for the scale factors for the classifier \textit{tight-ID} working point. Comparisons between different simulation configurations are presented and discussed.

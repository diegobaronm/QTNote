Due to the fact that our SFs are defined as a double ratio, we expect some of the systematic uncertainties to cancel at least at first order. Therefore, luminosity, light-lepton and physics modelling uncertainties are expected to be reduced. Unfortunately, tau-lepton reconstruction and MJ background estimation uncertainties do not cancel in the double ratio method. Then, we expect them to dominate the measurement precision.
